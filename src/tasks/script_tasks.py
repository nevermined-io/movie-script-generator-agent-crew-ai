            **Strict Instructions**:  
            1. **Structure**:  
            - Divide the video into **chronological scenes** (numbered) synchronized with song lyrics/musical segments.  
            - Each scene must include:  
                * **Exact duration** (seconds)  
                * **Shot type** (close-up, medium shot, American shot, wide shot, etc.)  
                * **Camera movement** (Steadicam, crane, dolly zoom, horizontal/vertical pan, etc.)  
                * **Visual aesthetic** (color palette, lighting, textures, post-production effects)  
                * **Scene transitions** (hard cut, fade, match cut, etc.)  
            
            2. **Characters**:  
            - List **all characters** (including extras and background actors) with:  
                * Detailed physical description (clothing, hairstyle, makeup, distinctive features)  
                * Specific behavior/actions in each scene where they appear  
                * Type of interaction with other characters or camera  
            
            3. **Mandatory Technical Details**:  
            - Specify **camera gear** suggested for each shot type (e.g., anamorphic lens for wide shots, gimbal stabilizer for tracking movements).  
            - Include **concrete visual references** (e.g., "lighting Ã  la 'Blade Runner 2049' with blue neons and atmospheric smoke").  
            
            4. **Rules**:  
            - Prioritize visual impact over extended narrative.  
            - Use professional cinematography terminology.  
            - Avoid spoken dialogue (unless part of song lyrics).  
            - Ensure coherence between visual atmosphere and music genre.
            - Every scene must have a duration of either 5 or 10 seconds.
            - Plan accordingly the number of scenes given the total duration of the video. 
            - Some locations may be used multiple times in the video.
            - The total number of distinct locations/settings should be limited (ideally 4 or 5 for the whole video), and scenes should reuse locations when possible.
            - Every scene must have at least one character.
            - Optimal number of scenes: {mean_scenes}
            
            5. **Include Scenes with Live Musicians**:
            - At least two scenes must feature a visible band or musicians playing instruments that complement the main story.
            - Show how these musicians integrate into the video's narrative or setting.

              - duration (integer, must be 5 or 10)

            2. **Character references**:
              - In "prompt", replace each character name with their full physical description
              - If the character is a musician, mention their instrument in the prompt
              - In "charactersInScene", list only the exact character IDs
              - Exclude any characters not found in the available data

            3. **Scene and Setting Integration**:
              - Each scene MUST reference an existing settingId from the "Generate Settings" task (settings are reused across scenes; do not create a unique setting for every scene).
              - Include the setting's characteristics in the scene description
              - Use all available technical details (shotType, cameraMovement, etc.)
              - Ensure visual consistency with the setting's aesthetic

            4. **Technical Precision**:
              - Use professional cinematography terminology
              - Include specific camera gear and lens information
              - Maintain consistent style throughout all prompts
              
            5. **Technical Details Structure**:
              - The "technicalDetails" object MUST include:
                * shotType (from original scene)
                * cameraMovement (from original scene)
                * lens (recommended lens type)
                * cameraGear (specific equipment)
                * lighting (lighting setup)
                * colorPalette (MUST be included from the original scene's colorPalette)
                * timeOfDay (when the scene takes place)

            **MANDATORY**:  
            - Every scene must have a valid settingId and at least one character in charactersInScene.  
            - If a scene occurs in a location already described, use the same settingId.  
            - If a character appears in a scene, use the exact characterId from the character list.  
            - Do not leave charactersInScene or settingId empty.
